# Introduction

`ragged` simplifies the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers an easy-to-use interface that supports both promise-based and event-driven inference.

## Why ragged?

LLMs currently offer non-standard APIs. `ragged` simplifies APIs for the frontend and backend by exposing a common interface that will eventually work across all LLMs.

## Roadmap

Currently in development, `ragged` is designed to provide a unified facade for interacting with various LLM APIs, including OpenAI, Cohere, and Anthropic, supporting diverse interaction patterns like text-to-text, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, text-to-image, and image-to-text.
