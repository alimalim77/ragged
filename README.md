## What is this?

Ragged is a 0-dependency, lightweight, universal LLM client for JavaScript and Typescript. It makes it easy to access LLMs via a simple, easy to understand, and uncomplicated API.

## Installation

Installing Ragged is very easy.

```bash
# either
npm install ragged
# or
pnpm install ragged
# or
yarn install ragged
```

That's it.

## Examples

### Simple chat

Ragged is very easy to use. Here is a complete application that shows chat completion.

```ts
// configure dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env
import { config } from 'dotenv';
config();

// import the Chat class from the ragged/chat module
import { Chat } from "ragged/chat"

// create a new Chat instance with the OpenAI provider
const c = Chat.with('openai', { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

// chat with the model
const messages = await c.chat('What is a rickroll?');

// log the messages
console.log(messages.at(-1)?.text); // A rickroll is a prank...
```

### Record history (a.k.a. memory)

The simplest way to work with history is to use the `.record` functionality.
